# Support

We want to help build a community that supports PhysiCell modelers and developers. We are still exploring options
for choosing a "best" online forum. Currently, we primarily use Slack. Unfortunately, it is by invite-only (and the invite itself expires after 30 days). Here's an [invite to join our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/physicellcomm-sf93727/shared_invite/zt-2m7g8i61i-~Swlq82LJdjFWH7i5uMEHw) (and we'll update that link upon expiration; if you have a problem, contact us via email). In the past, we've used [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/physicell/tickets) and that is still an option for filing trouble tickets or just asking questions. [GitHub Issues for the Studio](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio/issues) is another option. The `Help` menu of the Studio has a link to Issues page. In order to post to any of these sites, you will need to have an account (that's free). We have looked into several other social forums and they all come with pros and cons - cost, usability, security, etc.. If you have suggestions for ones that you like, please let us know!
