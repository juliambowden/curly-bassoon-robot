# Studio Overview

![](./images/tabs_only.png)

PhysiCell Studio consists of multiple tabs, each representing a logical grouping of model parameters and/or functionality.
Each tab will be described in detail in the sections below, but briefly they are:
* `Config Basics` - define the domain and other misc parameters of the simulation
* `Microenvironment` - define the microenvironment, i.e., one or more substrates (signals) and their parameters
* `Cell Types` - define one or more cell types and the phenotype parameters associated with each
* `User Params` - define optional "user" parameters that are unique to a particular model 
* `Rules` - optional "rules" associated with a cell type that define cell behaviors in response to signals
* `ICs` - convenience functionality to define simple 2D initial conditions (ICs) for cells
* `Run` - run a simulation and show the normal PhysiCell output to the terminal
* `Plot` - provide plotting options for visualizing output results (even while the simulation is being run)
