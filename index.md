# Introduction

PhysiCell Studio ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.24.563727v2)) is a graphical tool to simplify PhysiCell model editing. It provides a multi-tabbed GUI that allows graphical editing of the model and its associated XML, including the creation/deletion of fundamental objects, e.g., substrates (or signals) in the microenvironment, and cell types. It also lets users run their model and interactively visualize results, allowing for more rapid model refinement.

This User Guide provides brief, but hopefully sufficient, guidance on using the Studio - at least its contents (not the challenges involved in developing your particular model). If you experience problems or have questions, please contact us using an appropriate PhysiCell community Slack channel (see [Support](#support)) or the [Issues section](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio/issues) of the Studio GitHub repository. The latter is preferred when reporting a fatal error using the Studio. When reporting problems, please provide the Studio version # (found in the `Studio->About` menu) and the steps to reproduce the problem. We welcome Pull Requests in the [Studio repository](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio) (see instructions there) for bug fixes and suggested improvements.

This Guide will be updated as the Studio itself is updated, however there may be a lag. Therefore, if you are running a recent release of the Studio, you may notice some differences in the content described here.
